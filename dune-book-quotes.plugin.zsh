	# Princess Irulan
	"Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.\n - from \"The Humanity of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.\n - from \"Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers.\n - from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"There is probably no more terrible instance of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man--with human flesh.\n - from \"Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never persistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.\n - from \"Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.\n - from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan"

	"My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. \"Something cannot emerge from nothing,\" he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable \"the truth\" can be.\n - from \"Conversations with Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"Muad'Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us \"The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.\" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning \"That path leads ever down into stagnation.\"\n - from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"What do you despise? By this you are truly known.\n - from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"Prophecy and prescience--How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered questions? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the \"wave form\" (as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?\n - from \"Private Reflections on Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called \"spannungsbogen\"--which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.\n - from \"The Wisdom of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.\n - from \"In My Father's House\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"God created Arrakis to train the faithful.\n - from \"The Wisdom of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.\n - from \"Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.\n - from \"The Sayings of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"\"Control the coinage and the courts--let the rabble have the rest.\" Thus the Padishah Emperor advises you. And he tells you; \"If you want profits, you must rule.\" There is truth in these words, but I ask myself: \"Who are the rabble and who are the ruled?\"\n - Muad'Dib's Secret Message to the Landsraad from \"Arrakis Awakening\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.\n - from \"Muad'Dib: The Ninety-nine Wonders of The Universe\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.\n - from \"The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.\n - from \"Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries\" by the Princess Irulan"

	"Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.\n - Thufir Hawat"

	"It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.\n - Thufir Hawat"

	# Leto Atreides
	"Let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them.\n - Duke Leto Atreides"
	"Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity.\n - Duke Leto Atreides"
	"I must rule with eye and claw--as the hawk among lesser birds.\n - Duke Leto Atreides"
	"Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.\n - Duke Leto Atreides"
	"Knowing where the trap is, that's the first step in evading it.\n - Duke Leto Atreides"
	"Give as few orders as possible...Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.\n - Duke Leto Atreides"

	# Bene Gesserit
	"A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows.\n - from \"Manual of Muad'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan"
	"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\n - Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear"
	"Do not count a human dead until you've seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.\n - Bene Gesserit saying"
	"The mind can go either direction under stress--toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.\n - Bene Gesserit axiom"
	"When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong â€“ faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.\n - Bene Gesserit proverb"

	# Reverend Mother
	"You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.\n - Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam"

	"A world is supported by four things...the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave.

	# Stilgar
	"To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise.\n - Stilgar"
	"Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land.
